Source code of the fifth problem set in the CS50x course utilizing the C programming language.

'/bmp' contains the source code of 3 projects, where 'copy.c' creates an identical file of the inputted file (this was used to learn the basics of I/O), 'resize.c' resizes an inputted .bmp image based on an integer, and 'whodunit.c' removed the reddish-noise of the whodunit.bmp image.

'/jpg' is a more forensic based project, where 'recover.c' recovers all the .jpg photos located within the 'card.raw' file.
